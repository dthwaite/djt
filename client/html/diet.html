        <h1>Diet</h1>
        <p>We are what we eat</p>
        <p>It was only about 3 years ago when it finally sunk in for me the importance of diet</p>
        <p>That was when I really understood the atrocious state of modern food production</p>
        <p>And realised just how bad <strong>sugar</strong> is</p>
        <p>And realised just how bad <strong>factory farming</strong> is</p>

            <p>Our society has evolved to supply us with bad food inefficiently, cruelly (to us and other animals) and unsustainably.

        <h3>Opinion</h3>
        <p>Since my diet epiphany I slimmed down to my correct weight - a reduction of some 20 kilos.</p>
        <p>It now all makes perfect sense. Back to evolution: We evolved to process foods that have been
        fairly stable and available in our environment for millions of years.
        But about 20,000 years ago our diet starts to change due to the invention of farming.
            In particular we learn how to cultivate wheat and we start to be able to feed ourselves
            with a carbohydrate rich diet.</p>
        <p>We no longer work hard, like any other animal, to hunt and catch another as a necessity for survival.
        Now we manufacture animals on a vast scale so we can eat a delicious burger for a few dollars. So easy for the consumer.
        So nice for the consumer. So superfluous for the consumer. So devastating for the planet and our future.</p>
        <p>Ignorance really is bliss. But living life in a way that knowingly relies on ignorance is unhealthy to put it mildly.</p>
        <h3>Sugar</h3>
        <p>A few hundred years ago, we took slavery to whole new level
            and used it to supply sugar in huge quantities that allowed the population at large to grow addicted to the stuff.
            Sugar is pure energy for our bodies and evolution has provided us a means to make hay while the sun shines.
            There's way more energy released by the injestion of sugar than the body needs. So it does the obvious thing and
            stores that energy away for later use. Great when you were a hunter gatherer and you came across some ripe fruit
            or a bees nest. For those times were few and far between. Not so great now when the next snack or meal will contain
            another sugar fix. So the body gets stressed by producing excessive amounts of insulin time after time to convert
            the sugar into fat for storage. This whole cycle is wrecking many lives both in poor as well as rich nations. Not
            only does it make you fat (which then invites a whole host of other problems), but it also wrecks your sugar management
            system and you end up with diabetes type 2.</p>
        <p>The problem is we love sugar, of course we do. As hunter gatherers a sugar source was a rare energy opportunity not to be missed.
        So we have a natural bias to ingest as much of it as possible (which is what the "like" sensation is for)
        The food industry, not surprisingly, cottoned on to this a long time ago. Stuff sugar in your products and people will like them
        and therefore buy them and so your profits will go up. Best of all, sugar has been shown to be addictive so get your
        customers addicted to the stuff and you're onto a winner. Drug dealers know this trick.</p>
        <p>The sale and marketing of sugar as it now is on a global scale is an absolute traversty of our modern world.
            What's more it's our kids that are bearing the brunt of this onslaught.
            It's only in the last decade that we're starting to realise this.
            But regulating the food industry to the extent that it needs will be a very long process. Just think how slow the process
        has been to cut tobacco companies down. They are still in business and look what they produce - a completely pointless
        and needless product to suck smoke into your lungs when it is a known to kill you.</p>
        <p>Like alchohol and tobacco, sugar should be seen as a luxury product for occasional "treat" use.
            To injest any of these as a habitual way of life in currently "acceptable" quantities is no way to live a long and healthy life.</p>
        <p>Individuals can and do resist the onslaught, but we're not built to easily defend ourselves against this and many people, entirely understandably,
        cannot cope with it. It's not their fault. It is the fault of the society that we have built.</p>
        <h3>Factory farming</h3>
        <p>There is so much wrong with industrial farming that it is hard to decide where to start.
            I should confess my suspicions about the wrongness of industrial farming was seeded just a few years
        ago and it is only very recently that I have understood the full situation. And the situation is nothing less that <strong>appalling</strong>.</p>
        <p>Put it this way, as someone who is concerned about our planet and the animals (including us) that inhabit it
        I have had no choice but to turn Vegan from 2016 onward. Better late than never.</p>
        <p>So where do I start? Perhaps the overriding theme is this: for humans, our consumption of animal sourced products
        is just about the most unsustainable and inefficient means of subsisting that you could possibly invent. And that's before
        you factor in the extreme cruelty of harvesting and culling sentient animals for our misplaced desires.
        I'm not going to go into the nuts and bolts of this, but suffice to say that the resources required to build, feed, farm, slaughter
        animals, be they cows, chicken, fish or whatever, are staggering. Let me pick out one example. To build a burger takes 2,500 gallons of
        water. Next time some-one asks you to save water by taking shorter showers, you may as well skip your next burger
            and have as many showers as you like. Water's the tip of the iceberg though. Vast tracts of land are being cultivated
        all over the world (with disastrious ecological consequences) to grow the food to feed the animals. If we simply ate that food
        cutting out the middle man, we'd need a small fraction of those resources. It's one big fat middle man.</p>
        <p>Animal farming has by far the biggest impact on global warming. Want to have a meaningful impact on your carbon footprint?
        Don't eat meat. The list goes on and on. Just visit <a href="http://www.cowspiracy.com" target="_blank">Cowspiracy</a> which is
        a really good summarisation of the state of affairs. This is no fad. It's all backed by proper peer reviewed scientific
        papers. It's all as true as global warming is true. They'll always be deniers, but such people don't subscribe to the
        scientific method and arguments are futile.</p>
        <p>It is popular to think that vegans or vegetarians are sappy bunny lovers. It's true (because I am one), but that's
        not why I've turned vegan. But frankly, even if, by some miracle, animal farming was sustainable and good for the planet
        the cruelty involved goes against all human dignity. We want to be good and we want to be kind. There is very little
        difference between us and other sentient animals. They feel joy and pain, comfort and suffering. We should not be
        allowing ourselves to be inhumane. These animals need to live naturally. It is true that nature is unfeeling and there's
        suffering in the natural world wherever you look. But we've taken suffering to a new level. It's not good.</p>
        <p>Industrial farming cannot continue because it will run out of resources. It is not self sustaining. Not by a very long way.
        I like to hope it will cease because humans will realise, on a global level, that they can live without it and that we
        gain real control of living in a sustainable way on a planet which harbours a rich panoply of living beauty.</p>
