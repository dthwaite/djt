        <h1>Diet</h1>
        <p>We are what we eat</p>
        <p>It was only about 3 years ago when it finally sunk in for me the importance of diet</p>
        <p>That was when I really understood the atrocious state of modern food production</p>
        <p>And realised just how bad <strong>sugar</strong> is!</p>
        <p>And realised just how bad <strong>animal farming</strong> is!</p>

        <h3>Opinion</h3>
        <p>Since my diet epiphany I slimmed down to my correct weight - a reduction of some 20 kilos.</p>
        <p>It now all makes perfect sense. Back to evolution: We evolved to process foods that have been
        fairly stable and available in our environment for millions of years.
        But about 20,000 years ago our diet starts to change due to the invention of farming.
            In particular we learn how to cultivate wheat and we start to be able to feed ourselves
            with a carbohydrate rich diet.</p>
        <h3>Sugar</h3>
        <p>A few hundred years ago, we took slavery to whole new level
            and used it to supply sugar in huge quantities that allowed the population at large to grow addicted to the stuff.
            Sugar is pure energy for our bodies and evolution has provided us a means to make hay while the sun shines.
            There's way more energy released by the injestion of sugar than the body needs. So it does the obvious thing and
            stores that energy away for later use. Great when you were a hunter gatherer and you came across some ripe fruit
            or a bees nest. For those times were few and far between. Not so great now when the next snack or meal will contain
            another sugar fix. So the body gets stressed by producing excessive amounts of insulin time after time to convert
            the sugar into fat for storage. This whole cycle is wrecking many lives both in poor as well as rich nations. Not
            only does it make you fat (which then invites a whole host of other problems), but it also wrecks your sugar management
            system and you end up with diabetes type 2.</p>
        <p>The problem is we love sugar, of course we do. As hunter gatherers a sugar source was a rare energy opportunity not to be missed.
        So we have a natural bias to ingest as much of it as possible (which is what the "like" sensation is for)
        The food industry, not surprisingly, cottoned on to this a long time ago. Stuff sugar in your products and people will like them
        and therefore buy them and so your profits will go up. Best of all, sugar has been shown to be addictive so get your
        customers addicted to the stuff and you're onto a winner. Drug dealers know this trick.</p>
        <p>The sale and marketing of sugar as it now is on a global scale is an absolute traversty of our modern world.
            What's more it's our kids that are bearing the brunt of this onslaught.
            It's only in the last decade that we're starting to realise this.
            But regulating the food industry to the extent that it needs will be a very long process. Just think how slow the process
        has been to cut tobacco companies down. They are still in business and look what they produce - a completely pointless
        and needless product to suck smoke into your lungs when it is a known to kill you.</p>
        <p>Like alchohol and tobacco, sugar should be seen as a luxury product for occasional "treat" use.
            To injest any of these as a habitual way of life in currently "acceptable" quantities is no way to live a long and healthy life.</p>
        <p>Individuals can and do resist the onslaught, but we're not built to easily defend ourselves against this and most people, entirely understandably,
        cannot cope with it. It's not their fault. It is the fault of the society that we have built.</p>
