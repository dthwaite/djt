        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p><strong>20+ years</strong> hands-on development experience in multiple technical environments and languages.
            Mainly within the banking industry (real time trading and analytics) but more recently
            involving cloud based applications for a variety of industries.</p>
        <h4>I Seek to ...</h4>
        <p>Continue to draw on the deep satisfaction I get from developing well designed, accurate, tested, performant,
            documented functionality in challenging technical/business environments.</p>
        <h4>I work for ...</h4>
        <p><strong>£500+/day</strong> contracting in a <strong>banking</strong> or similarly <strong>challenging</strong> environment.
            Happy to <strong>remote</strong> in part.</p>
        <h4>Current Technical Involvement</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><mark>JavaScript</mark>, <mark>HTML5</mark>, <mark>CSS3</mark> using <mark>Less</mark>, <mark>Jquery</mark>,

            <li><mark>Eclipse</mark> & <mark>WebStorm</mark> IDE, <mark>SVN</mark> management, <mark>ANT</mark> scripting, external tools</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Recent Technical Experience</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Flex <mark>AS3</mark> presenting extensive client-side functionality</li>
            <li><mark>RabbitMQ</mark> design and use</li>
            <li><mark>APEX</mark> on SalesForce and API integration</li>
            <li>Google Glass integration</li>
            <li><mark>XSLT</mark> transforming structured search results into hierarchical HTML documents</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Historic Programming/DB Experience</h4>
        <p><mark>C</mark>, <mark>C++</mark>, <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>Sybase</mark>, <mark>Foxpro</mark>, <mark>AIMS</mark>:
            I have practiced these extensively in the past and, at the time, would have been considered highly proficient.
            I am a developer, the language is the tool which, with familiarity, allows me to develop with speed and accuracy.</p>
        <h4>Technical Opinion</h4>
        <p>I am very curious. I always seek to understand the technology I use at a deeper level which ensures that I naturally
            understand the opportunities and limitations. I am fascinated with the broader technical landscape including
            a) the services provided by the likes of Amazon (<mark>AWS</mark>), Google and others
            b) the evolvement of <mark>NoSQL</mark> persistence engines like <mark>MongoDB</mark> and
            c) advanced application building environments such as <mark>Meteor</mark>. I favour roles that involve such things which allows me to expand my hands-on experience.</p>

        <h3>Three examples of delivery challenges</h3>
        <p>These examples target specific, recent and interesting challenges which demonstrate my versatility and analytical approach.
            I do not have space to review the large scale, team oriented software development projects undertaken at Lehman Brothers, Barclays Capital or Code Vanilla.
            I have full documentation for the below should these be of any further interest.</p>

        <h4>Remit: To provide a credible <mark>Google Glass</mark> (GG) experience by viewing and interacting with content from Code Vanilla’s (CV) knowledge system.</h4>
        <p>This required me to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyse the GG design pattern and decide on the optimum mapping between CV’s knowledge and collaboration content and GG content</li>
            <li>Understand and implement Google’s sophisticated authentication and authorisation model to allow a user to seamlessly move between CV’s cloud environment and GG</li>
            <li>Understand and implement Google’s API for two way messaging between CV’s application and GG</li>
            <li>Implement full functionality in PHP to transfer content and to broker messaging such that both GG and CV’s web application reacted simultaneously in real time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Remit: To allow for the entry, review and synchronisation of overlapping structured customer data held in 3 completely different repositories</h4>
            <p>The systems involved were <mark>SalesForce</mark>, a Music Catalogue system and an external accounting system requiring me to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Design a system of asynchronous communication between all 3 systems
                - I used the <mark>RabbitMQ</mark> queuing infrastructure which protected against end-point unavailability</li>
            <li>Establish and document a complete mapping of entities and fields</li>
            <li>Establish a cross referencing system for entity identifiers</li>
            <li>Design and implement the logic to ensure any CRUD change in one system is reflected in the others
                while also permitting the ability to switch on or off the mappings</li>
            <li>Establish a thorough error reporting component to the whole arrangement</li>
            <li>Put in place monitoring and alert systems to detect system outages or failures</li>
            <li>Put in place a detailed logging system to aid system performance diagnostics</li>
            <li>Learn <mark>APEX</mark> and the Salesforce environment to develop the necessary triggers and code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The design actually catered for any number of disparate systems.
            As is so often the case a more generic solution is the clearer one.
            It was implemented in NodeJS.</p>

        <h4>Remit: To devise a feature in a Music Catalogue System (MCS) to advise a user of other tracks that sound like the one currently under review.</h4>
        <p>Tracks in MCS are keyworded so one might conclude that this is simply an exercise in finding the tracks with the most overlapping keywords.
            For a number of reasons this is not good enough and the solution involved:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The categorisation of keywords and automatically weighting them in significance based on their existing use and context</li>
            <li>The invention and implementation of a % scoring system for the likeness of one track with another</li>
            <li>Ensuring a fast response (calculation of like tracks) by maintaining intermediate weighting factors against every track;
                things change as the catalogue system is maintained (tracks added, keywords changed etc)</li>
            <li>Developing and optimising the <mark>complex SQL</mark> unions and joins to effect the result</li>
            <li>Providing an easy to use diagnostic tool for catalogue administrators that explain the score of one track against another so they may adjust keywording if necessary</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When tested by music experts they reported that the system was uncanny in its accuracy and insight without the need for any further algorithmic adjustments.</p>

        <h4>1991-2003 Front office trading developer and project manager at <strong>Lehman Brothers</strong></h4>
        <p><mark>C++</mark> development on Unix (initially <mark>Foxpro</mark> on PC) with <mark>Sybase</mark> backend delivering a trading and risk management system
            to the government trading desk. I was steadily promoted within the firm to more senior project management roles
            expanding my responsibilities to build out the London based trading system internationally.
            I consequently spent 2 years in the New York office delivering to the credit trading desk.</p>
        <h4>Ancient history</h4>
        <p>Prior to Lehman I held a number of positions all involving programming. These included working for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arbat Ltd</strong> using their proprietary language AIMS to manage back office banking</li>
            <li><strong>Lloyds bank</strong> (in New York) who used Arbat’s banking system</li>
            <li><strong>Amro bank</strong> who used Arbat’s banking system</li>
            <li><strong>ODT Ltd</strong> A partnership developing an equity valuation system written in C delivered on PC</li>
            <li><strong>Tellus Ltd</strong> Various consultancies using DBASE III</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I was educated in England to A level standard and started programming in <mark>BASIC</mark> at the age of 15 and moved swiftly on to <mark>8080 assembly language</mark>.
            I spent one year at Imperial College of London University studying Computer Science.
            I didn’t see the point and left to get a programming job. So no degree, I’m afraid.</p>
        <h3>Postscript</h3>
        <p>I am a very experienced developer/architect with 15 years financial experience and 10 years project and team management.
            I know what makes a development manager happy because I’ve been one.
            Naturally, I communicate well and am friendly and effective in a team environment.</p>

                    <p>First of all, they are the companies I have worked for.</p>
                    <p>I thought it would be fun to have them bouncing around the confines of the window which required a few minor
                    challenges. Notice how they bounce inside the window and are not subject to any scrolling. I made a class
                    to bounce an object within its parent and added a few features like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The images size down automatically to ensure they do not take more than a given % of the window area</li>
                        <li>The images can bounce off the walls with a given degree of inaccuracy - thus the bounces can be randomly
                        inaccurate to ensure they do not get into a regular (and boring) transit</li>
                        <li>If you click in the window it stops/starts the animation</li>
                        <li>Their speed can be set to any number of pixels per second (50 here)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It took me a while to work out the right bouncing angle based on
                    what wall the image first hit at what angle of approach (back to high school trigonometry)</p>
                    <p>This little feature is a good example of one where you'd expect to find some library on the web to do.
                    I couldn't find anything that really matched my need/circumstance. Besides, you find so many code snippets/classes
                    people have written and publish which are, I'm afraid, woefully lacking in quality. Pick a duffer and you'll spend
                    more time trying to make it work than writing your own.</p>
