        <h1>Sailing</h1>
        <p>I love the sea</p>
        <p>Being on a boat is so <em>different</em> to any other outdoor activity</p>
        <p>You get to discover a different aspect of our planet and new places to visit on land</p>
        <p>In 2015 I <a href="http://domsroundbritainsail.uk" target="_blank">sailed round Britain single handed</a></p>

        <p>I went on quite a few sailing holidays as a boy but once I started working I didn't sail at all.
        It wasn't until my mid forties when I suddenly got the desire to rediscover this lost past-time.
        I started by taking RYA courses and then bought my own 25 foot yacht once I felt I had enough knowledge.
        This I sailed, for a few days at a time, on the East coast until I had enough experience to take
        my Offshore Yachtmasters examination, which I duly passed.</p>
        <p>I then spent quite a few happy years sailing with family, friends or on my own and got to know the East
        coast rather well. In 2015 a confluence of events meant that I had the opportunity to undertake a significant
        sailing challenge which was to sail round Britain single handedly. I spent a couple of months preparing and
        managed to get all the way round in one of the worst weather years ever to befall one with this ambition.
        Needless to say it was a most exhilerating experience and it is recorded in full and gory detail
        on my "<a href="http://domsroundbritainsail.uk" target="_blank">Dom's round Britain Sail</a>" site.</p>
        <p>There are a number of things that I find very satisfying about sailing. In order to navigate our busy
            inshore waters you really do need to know how to conduct yourself and it's a refreshing different world
        out there on the open sea. Apart from when you get caught in some gale, it's a very tranquil activity which
        gives you lots of time to think in a relaxed manner. The act of getting from A to B using wind alone is a
        wonderful experience. There's also great comraderie amongst us sailors and you often get to meet different
        people from all walks of life. But the joy of arriving into harbour followed by a home cooked meal and explorations
        of the locality is hard to beat. And if you arrive at night it is simply magical.</p>
