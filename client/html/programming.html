        <h1>Programming</h1>
        <p>I love programming. I find it deeply rewarding.</p>
        <p>Why is this?</p>
        <p>I think it's because you get to <em>build</em> stuff that demonstrably works
            with the opportunity to do it neatly, efficiently and beautifully.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of ways to program badly and the act of avoiding those ways is satisfying!</p>

        <h4>Opinion</h4>
        <p>So what makes a good developer? Here's my (rather extensive) take on this question:</p>
        <p><strong>A good developer</strong> is in possession of some core competencies
            which are independent from technical specifics. That developer may then optimise the application
            of those competencies through their familiarity with a particular environment that consists of 5 axes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Language and syntax</li>
            <li>IDE and development tools</li>
            <li>Wider technical context</li>
            <li>Libraries and services</li>
            <li>Functional awareness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Core, high level competencies are to have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a thorough appreciation of the value of the 5 environmental axes listed above</li>
            <li>a deep understanding of Object Orientation</li>
            <li>a good intuition of “what goes on underneath”</li>
            <li>an avid attention to detail</li>
            <li>a strong passion for beauty and elegance of design</li>
            <li>a heavy bias towards generalisation at all levels</li>
            <li>a continuous commitment to implement once-only - however small that may be</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a developer exhibits these qualities then the rest follows as noted in the following drill-down:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A thorough appreciation of the value of the 5 environmental axes listed above
                <ul>
                    <li>Language and syntax, a good developer:
                        <ul>
                            <li>can pick up the basics of a new language fairly quickly</li>
                            <li>knows the necessity to understand its full capabilities</li>
                            <li>understands the value of familiarity to increase productivity</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>IDE and development tools, a good developer:
                        <ul>
                            <li>understands the huge potential for increased productivity if they know their development tools well</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Wider technical context, a good developer:
                        <ul>
                            <li>understands and uses existing libraries and services to ensure re-use</li>
                            <li>has a nose for seeking out (quality) libraries and services in preference to re-inventing the wheel and vocalises their view</li>
                            <li>suggests or builds libraries and services where applicable to benefit the immediate or wider community</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Functional awareness, a good developer:
                        <ul>
                            <li>knows the value of understanding the business functional environment</li>
                            <li>is active in making suggestions on functional improvements/innovations</li>
                            <li>ensures they understand and deliver non-business functional requirements</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A deep understanding of Object Orientation, a good developer:
                <ul>
                    <li>Never shies from building a new class when appropriate</li>
                    <li>Always carefully considers the best class hierarchy and architecture</li>
                    <li>Makes full use of the languages OO features</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A good intuition of “what goes on underneath”, a good developer:
                <ul>
                    <li>understands the technology stack</li>
                    <li>thinks about the consequences of calling on that stack</li>
                    <li>pays heed to network and cpu limitations</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>An avid attention to detail, a good developer:
                <ul>
                    <li>presents their code meticulously</li>
                    <li>documents their code appropriately</li>
                    <li>always considers edge and race conditions</li>
                    <li>participates in building relevant test cases</li>
                    <li>may implement “fudges” when necessary but annotates these vehemently</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A strong passion for beauty and elegance of design, a good developer:
                <ul>
                    <li>draws deep satisfaction from good design</li>
                    <li>organises their code into manageable chunks and namespaces</li>
                    <li>avoids obfuscation at all costs, even when the language encourages it</li>
                    <li>is always ready to redesign for continuous improvement within reason</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A heavy bias towards generalisation at all levels, a good developer:
                <ul>
                    <li>avoids “hard coding” like the plague</li>
                    <li>detects potential functional variabilities and designs to accommodate change</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A continuous commitment to implement once-only, a good developer:
                <ul>
                    <li>understands that refactoring is a natural, core part of on-going development</li>
                    <li>always seeks to further generalise existing code rather than re-implement a specific variation</li>
                    <li>encapsulates functionality for re-use at all levels, however minor</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
