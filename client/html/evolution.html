        <h1>Evolution</h1>
        <p>The scientific discovery of evolution by Darwin and others must rate as one of the biggest game changers in human history.</p>
        <p>Today, two hundred years on, the evidence for evolution is massive, varied and incontrovertible.</p>
        <p>Yet it is still very sparsely understood, appreciated or even believed.</p>
        <p><strong>How come?</strong></p>

        <h4>Opinion</h4>
        <p>I'd consider myself pretty well educated yet I didn't "get" evolution for most of my life.
            Claiming that some dumb, natural process could create the richness of life as we know it just seemed so outrageous.</p>
        <p>The alternative of putting it down to some super-being was all but inescapable before Darwin and still highly tempting after.</p>

        <p>It's our intuition that lets us down.
            But intuition didn't develop so that we may understand such things.
            It developed to help us survive in our local environment.</p>
        <p>The scientific process (Surely humankind's biggest achievement of all) allows us to decipher the objective truth of the world
            transcending our natural, but often unhelpful, preconceptions.</p>
        <p>Strip away your natural inclination for incredulity and look at the harsh reality and you discover that the evolutionary process
            is not only possible (given the enormous, unimaginable time scales involved) but, most probably, inevitable.</p>
        <p>The reason most people can't or won't subscribe to evolution is simple: <strong>It's too far removed from our intuition.</strong>
            And it requires some fairly serious thought to push that intuition aside.</p>
        <p>Our natural understanding of the world is only what is necessary to survive in our local environment.
            It is merely a very limited interpretation. An interpretation full of assumptions, short-cuts and outright subterfusions.</p>
        <p>Once people are educated to this fact and to the scientific method then understanding and accepting evolution becomes easy.
            Education is the key and is most easily performed on the young. Educating adults is much harder.
            Adults have built up a huge repository of preconceptions (or misconceptions) which are stuck in like cement.
            Trouble is, adults educate children. So breaking the cycle of transferring misconceptions down the generations is tricky.</p>
        <p>Richard Dawkins (unsurprisingly) got me to understand evolution properly and I've read all his books as well as a few others on the subject.
        It's a fascinating story.</p>
