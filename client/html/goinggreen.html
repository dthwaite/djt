        <h3>Opinion</h3>
        <p>It's taken me a long time to become an eco freak! In fact it was only a few years ago when I shamefully
        stockpiled a load of 100 watt incandescent light bulbs as they were being phased out for more efficient
        (but less bright) alternatives. I've still got them as a reminder of past sins.</p>
        <p>For me, becoming eco aware has been a slow process with intermittent jumps
        into deeper commitment. A rather obvious question is "Why be eco friendly?". Afer all, there are many
        other deserving causes to apply ourselves including poverty, disease, abuse, cruelty and war. The difference is
        that most of us are actively contributing to the ecological problem by living our daily lives in an unsustainable way.
        It does not take much to change our lifestyle to make a dramatic change in our personal contribution (or carbon foot-print).
        If we all, individually, made such changes then it really would make a very big difference. Of course, only some of us
        do, but that's no reason to not bother.</p>
        <p>Besides, this whole issue mostly boils down to energy availability. And energy plays a big part in shaping global politics
            as a result of inequalities that in turn drive bad things to happen (wars etc). If we could produce and consume energy
            in a sustainable way it must surely help in solving our other problems. There is a big white hope out there for energy: Nuclear Fusion.
            But that is decades away at best and by that time much of the damage will have been done. So instead of betting
            on a limitless and clean energy source like Nuclear Fusion, we have to to learn to use less because we can only produce
            a limited amount of clean energy using existing technology.
        </p>
        <p>I think there is a slow awakening by the masses that change is easy to do. For many people, recycling is now common place.
        Insulating your home, saving water and switching the lights off is very much in our collective consciousness
        which was not the case ten or twenty years ago. For many this makes real financial sense, but most people would do
        it anyway because they know it is good for the planet. Our governments have been reasonably effective in bringing
        about this change. On the flip side, I would argue that western (rich) nations could do much, much more.</p>
        <p>America, in particular has been very slow to react. Big business is making too much money. Big farming. Big auto manufacturers.
        It should be far clearer that the days of the internal combustion engine are numbered. There will come a day when
        driving a petrol car, van or truck will be seen as unhealthy as smoking an unfiltered cigarette. Such cars will be as
        old hat as VDU screens are for computers. Petrol stations will go into rapid decline. In twenty years time things will look very different.</p>
        <p>But I would prefer to see our chidren being actively educated <strong>now</strong> in how they <strong>should</strong> be living
        in a way that is sustainable both for the planet and for themselves. That way a new generation will grow up with these ideas
        firmly established. Children should be taught more about how to eat properly. Foods which are bad for the planet and bad for consumption
        should be actively discouraged - sugar and meat should be available in dramatically lower quantities. Children should
        be taught that they have a responsibility as citizens of the world to live economically. Children should be taught that they have
        a responsibility to ensure they do not indulge in luxuries which are unsustainable or are damaging to other parts of the world.
        Children should be taught that there is no morality in consuming things that have involved cruelty to our fellow animals or that actively
        reduces the rich diversity of life on our planet. These things are not high on the curriculum agenda. Instead, it's all about passing GCSEs and
        A-levels in order to go to University. The balance is way off kilter in my view.</p>
        <p>So my ambition, in a few years, is to build my own super-energy efficient home. It will be a <a href="www.passivhaus.org.uk" target="_blank">Passivhaus</a>.
        These houses are (for about 5% extra build cost) ten times more energy efficient than your average home in the UK. It will have sufficient
        solar and ground source heat to be energy positive - i.e. it is perfectly feasible to have a modern house with all electrical and heating needs
        met by on-site energy sources. All new housing, in my view, should have far better energy profiles than current building regulations stipulate.
        For people who live in energy efficient houses (or business premises) the financial rewards are continuous. But the construction business has not
        adjusted yet and they rely on (as ever) short-termism to turn a profit for their share holders and the government does not want to upset them.</p>
