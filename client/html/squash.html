        <h1>Squash</h1>
        <p>What a wonderful sport</p>
        <p>It's physically very demanding and gives a fantastic cardio workout</p>
        <p>It's a skillful, competitive game that is hugely rewarding</p>
        <p>There's no down-time. You're playing <em>all</em> the time</p>

        <p>I've been an active member at my local club for almost 10 years now. In fact I'm on the committee
        and organise all the club tournaments.</p>
        <p>I play about 3 times a week, but am rather mediocre being just below club team standard. Doesn't bother
        me as I generally have cracking games and enjoy every minute of it.</p>
        <p>Squash keeps you fit, no doubt about it. In a typical 45 minute session, you'd expend 600-700 calories so
        it's a great way to control your weight as part of a healthy diet. They say it is the most energy sapping
        sport, which I can well imagine. You end a session drenched in sweat.</p>
        <p>I used to play when I was much younger but then stopped. In my mid-forties I took it up again discovering
        that it had a bit of an old man's reputation. Many squash clubs succumbed to the surge in appetite for gyms
        and I think it's much less of a game than it used to be in my youth. That said, my club has grown a very
        active "juniors" section over the last few years and so I think it has clawed back some credibility with
        the younger generation. Amazingly it is not an olympic sport; much to the consternation of the Squash Association.</p>
