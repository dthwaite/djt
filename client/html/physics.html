        <h1>Physics</h1>
        <p>Our universe fascinates me</p>
        <p>I devour popular science books that cover the two pillars of modern physics:</p>
        <p>- The General Theory of Relativity</p>
        <p>- Quantum Mechanics</p>
        <p>I fully intend to take a degree course in Physics when I retire</p>

    <div class="well well-lg">
        <h4>Opinion</h4>
        <p>Of the two, the General Theory of Relatively is hands down the most elegant and beautiful.
            Quantum Mechanics is comparatively messy describing a mini smorgasbord of basic particles and interactions.
        But you can't deny that it's breathtaking in its ability to explain pretty much all physical phenomena.</p>
        <p>My take on these two fantastic scientific achievements:</p>
        <h4>The General Theory of Relativity</h4>
        <p>The basic idea is stunningly simple, though I fully admit to not understanding the maths (hence why
        I want to take a Physics degree). The theory describes the universe as a 4 dimensional continuum of space and time
        in a way that essentially means that all four dimensions are in the same currency - the time dimension merges with
        the space dimensions.</p>
        <p>The theory also describes how this space-time continuum is not completely "flat" meaning that its 4 dimensions
        can locally expand and contract ("curve" as it's commonly described) as a result of the influence of matter</p>
        <p>No one can picture this (and thus deeply understand) this situation and my "<a id="understanding" href="">understanding the impossible</a>"
            note helps me, at least, to come to terms with this.</p>
        <p>Before I had read much about the General Theory of Relativity I understood the deep weirdness of
        walking around on Earth. At school, they would tell you that if you dropped a stone it would undergo an acceleration
        of 1G. But this is nonsense. Because I experience an acceleration of 1G all the time and I'm not dropping anywhere.
        In fact it's only when I jump off a high diving board that I achieve the more natural state of floating freely. That
        sensation you get in your stomach as you plummet towards the water is not because you are accelerating - it's because
        you are floating. Precisely the opposite; you are no longer accelerating. The people in the ISS, presumably, feel that all the time.</p>
        <p>So the "force" of gravity is not really a force. It's the ground stopping you from achieving your natural state of free-float.
        Gravity, as it turns out, is not a force at all. All matter is floating in the (locally warped) space-time continuum and if there is
        something stopping it from doing that then it will experience this as acceleration. </p>
        <p>I have a rather personal view on space-time in that it essentially adds up to nothing. Zero. Zero can also
        be expressed as one minus one. In other words, I see space and time to be equal opposites where if you have some space then you
            must have some negative time (time, as it happens, is a 'complex' quantity involving 'i' - the square root of -1).
            If you contract space to nothing (which would happen if you travelled at the speed of light) you run out of time too.
            It seems to me that matter then becomes a necessary addition as the concept of space and time without anything inside it seems rather abstract.
        </p>
        <h4>Quantum Mechanics</h4>
        <p>No matter how many books I read on this (and I have read quite a few; and re-read them) I still can't adequately explain it in layman terms.
        A very typical observation that physicists say, to try and sum things up, is that something can exist in two places at once.
            Or a cat in a box is alive and dead at the same time. I think this is a really nasty way to sum up quantum theory as it is clearly
        nonsensical and contradictory. It's as bad as saying that a banana can be an apple or a pear at the same time. I think this sort of explanation just teases
        the layman by saying "yeah, I know it's nonsense to you, that's why you can't understand it"</p>
        <p>I think it would be more helpful to explain that as you dissect the universe into ever smaller parts you get to a point
            where there are no longer any real "building blocks". The building blocks that we perceive have come about as a result of a vast averaging out
        of some kind of abstract activity going on in space-time. At the quantum level, it's wrong to say that something is both here and there.
            It's more accurate to say that there is nothing but that our being here forces an observable consequence of that abstract activity.</p>
        <p>To my mind, just like my observation that the sum of space-time is zero, so is the sum of all quantum activity. We cannot think of this activity
        as comprising of bits of things moving around. It's nothing like that. It's nothing like anything we have any hope to imagine. But whatever it is
        can be expressed mathematically. And that's what Quantum Mechanics does. It's a mathematical model.</p>
        <p>Mathematical models don't have to describe things that you can draw. For example, the model is pretty much built out of complex numbers
        (which involve the square root of -1). Who can understand what the square root of -1 is? On one side of the coin you could state there is no such thing
        as there is no number that you can square to yield a negaive number. On the other side we just say, well, lets <em>pretend</em> there's such a number -
        then all is fine. Complex numbers are sometimes referred to as "imaginary" numbers. But I don't see that they are any more imaginary than real numbers.
        All numbers, of whatever ilk, are just abstract representations. You can't draw a number, complex or otherwise.</p>
        <p>The wonderful thing about quantum theory is that the mathematical models really work. They allow us to exploit our averaged-out observable environment
        to our benefit. We can model how the universe really works (which we cannot imagine) and take control. Mathematics, the scientific process and our
        fantastic collaborative ability to model our world in ever greater depth and breadth has, is and will bring untold benefits to humanity. I find it
        hugely uplifting.</p>
        <h4>A Theory of Everything</h4>
        <p>Theories and models that work are wonderful. But just as Newtons laws ushered in the Industrial Revolution, they are not complete. Not complete
        in detail and not complete in coverage. That's why physicists have not written the ultimate scientific bible and all gone home to rest.
        Messy as quantum theory is, it's still remarkably terse considering it explains all of chemistry and  pretty much all of existence. But it does not explain,
         for example what goes on in black holes or what goes on at the birth of the universe. Neither does the Theory of Relativity. In those situations
        the two theories break down and contradict.</p>
        <p>The aim is to come up with a model that subsumes both General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics <em>and</em> explains, literally, all of existence.
        I optimistically think that we're not long (decades, not centuries) from that. Apart from the huge human satisfaction of having "cracked it", one
        can imagine the power we now have to control, predict and build anything we like. From then on, it's all just implementation. Our technology continues
        to grow at a "Moore's law" type rate. For billions of years the universe has blindly controlled us. It won't be long until we control the universe.
        Though the second law of thermodynamics will have it's way eventually.</p>

                    <p>Basically, don't even try! Can you imagine what a curved space-time continuum looks like?
                    Or can you imagine that a particle is actually spread out throughout the universe? Or can you imagine
                    billions of years of evolution? Of course you can't. No-one can.</p>
                    <p>That's because our brains have evolved under the principle of evolution in order to perpetuate our replicating genes.
                        Our bodies have developed sensory organs that interprete our surroundings (for the above purpose).
                        Electrical signals are then fired down nerves into our brains.
                        Our brains then construct a model of our environment. We can only imagine or picture things that our brains can model.
                        And the universe as it truly is looks absolutely <strong>nothing</strong> like our model. So understanding, at an intuitive level,
                    how the universe "looks" is completely beyond our tiny minds.</p>
                    <p>Dispite this we have, by some miracle, invented an objective way to represent things that we cannot imagine. It's called Mathematics.
                    Mathematics combined with the Scientific Process are the tools we use to escape the limitation of our minds. Together they have
                    proved truly obscene in their power.</p>
                    <p>Most physicists (and me also, though I can hardly claim to be one) subscribe to the "shut-up and calculate" doctrine.
                    This in effect means forget trying to understand, just do the Maths and if the Maths predicts things that coincide with
                    what our brain models perceive, then that can prove both useful and instructive.</p>
                    <p>The point I'm really making is that the universe doesn't really <em>look</em> like anything. It's all just energy (like The Matrix)
                    and it appears, quite bizzarly, that we can model this quite well using Mathematics.
                        What we experience is just an internal model to help us get around!</p>
