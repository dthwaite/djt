        <h3>The game of Life running on the server</h3>
        <canvas class="life-canvas"></canvas>
        <p>You can copy and paste the URL for this window into another browser and see these two games play out simultaneously.
            Click in either one and a new life object will be inserted into the game and both windows will reflect this.
            <br/><br/>
            This Life game iterates 4 times a second, each requiring a message from the server containing cell changes from one iteration to the next.
            Messaging is achieved with <mark>Meteor</mark>'s reactive infrastructure where cell changes are lodged in <mark>MongoDB</mark> on the server
            and the client subscribes to a live query of those changes. You can peruse the <a href="/docs/module-Life.html" target="_blank"> Life module JSDocs</a> or ...</p>

        <p>The server implementation allowed me to briefly explore the Meteor/MongoDB reactive query architecture and performance.
        I used <a href="https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up">mup</a> to deploy this site up to AWS. This plugin worked very nicely
        and set everything up just so on the server, including MongoDB. However, I quickly discovered that my Life game hammered
        the CPU on the server but not on my local dev machine. How so? The reason was that reactive queries (mongoDB find())
            are implemented by Meteor in one of two ways. The first, rather brutish way, is to repeatedly requery the database
            and compare the result set with the previous query and send any changes back to the client. The second is to use MongoDB's
            oplog to 'listen' for writes and send any of interest back to the client.</p>
        <p>The oplog method is employed on a development machine off the bat. But in production the oplog is not maintained unless you specifically ask for it.
            So this needs to be switched on by preparing MongoDB for replication (the oplog being the prime mover for replication).
            Once all this is done, then transmitting Life changes at the current rate of 4 iterations per second turns out
            to be surprisingly performant.
        </p>
        <p>One other gotcha is that the transport layer does not guarantee order. For many applications this would be a show stopper
        and even for my Life game this causes problems. So I had to built in a little home-grown order-resetter based on the fact
        that I knew iteration 'n' must always follow iteration 'n-1'.</p>
        <p>All the same, I can well imagine that with clustering, sharding and replication one could build a pretty acceptable real time system
        that dealt with rapidly changing data ... like an equity trading application.</p>

                    <p>The background to my evolution page contains a canvas on which the game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Life</a> is played out.
                        I have a <mark>javascript</mark> class that performs all the logic which runs in a <mark>worker thread</mark> in the browser.
                        The worker thread sends a message to the main UI thread every 100 milliseconds with a list of changed cells which are duly redrawn on the canvas.
                        While it may not be strictly necessary in this case, it is good practice to put client-side compute intensive calculations into a worker thread
                        so that the user does not suffer from degraded performance or responsiveness.</p>
                    <p>Below is a separate life game but with a difference; It runs on the server using the same life class used by the client-side worker thread.
                        Because this site uses <mark>NodeJS</mark>, I benefit from using a consistent language (<mark>javascript</mark>) on both server and client.
                        In this case the message containing changed cells comes from the server. This life game is uniquely identified so that you can view the same
                        game in real-time on a completely different computer (or <a href="/life#{{lifeId}}" target="_blank">new browser window</a>).</p>
