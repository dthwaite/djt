        <h1>About...</h1>
        <p>This site is built with <strong><a href="http://www.meteor.com" target="_blank">Meteor</a></strong></p>
        <p>It is deployed on <strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a></strong></p>
        <p>It's my technology playpen</p>
        <p>No pretty pictures here (I'm no a graphic designer)</p>

        <p>This site overviews my principle interests and some personal views on topics for which I have some passion.
        But I also use it to explore web technologies of interest. Making this a public site just ensures I manage a
        full production cycle as, behind the scenes, I like to explore frameworks and libraries of one sort or another
            like testing, documentation and release processes.</p>

        <p>It is work in progress because I add 'features' to the site not because they are useful (!), but because they
        are a vehicle for me to experiment with some technical capability. For example, on my <a href="/evolution">evolution page</a>
        I implemented the game of Life in two different ways - one client based and another server based which allowed me to
        explore Meteor's re-active infrastructure and <mark>MongoDb</mark>.</p>
        <p>I use <mark>JSDoc</mark> to document my code which I make available <a href="/docs/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>
        for my convenience. I write test scripts where appropriate using <mark>Jasmine</mark> and the whole site is source controlled
            using <a href="http://dthwaite.github.io/djt/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>I've put the <a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a> commenting system on most pages so feel free to comment.
        They're moderated, so it's gonna be kept sensible!</p>
