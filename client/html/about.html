        <h1>About...</h1>
        <p>This site is built with <strong><a href="http://www.meteor.com" target="_blank">Meteor</a></strong></p>
        <p>It is deployed on <strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a></strong></p>
        <p>It's my technology playpen.</p>
        <p>No pretty pictures here (I'm not a graphic designer).</p>

        <p>The main purpose is for me to have a personal "workbench" to test out, experiment and practice various
            programming/design patterns and tools.</p>
        <p>I make it into a public site just to add impetus to make sure I deploy stuff that I'm happy for other people
        to see and critique. So it forces me to reach production quality in the stuff I do here.</p>
        <p>I also use this site to allow potential clients to review the kind of stuff I'm into. It gives anyone
        who's considering taking me on as a contract developer to get a practical heads up on me beyond a resume.
            Resumes are notoriously subjective and can really only give a brief glimpse on an individual's capabilities</p>
        <p>To that end the whole site can be reviewed on <mark>GitHub</mark>, it employs what I consider to be best practice construction.
        The code is fully documented using <mark>JSDoc</mark> and has complete test scripts using <mark>Jasmine</mark></p>
        <p>I've put the <a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a> commenting system on most pages so feel free to comment.
        They're moderated, so it's gonna be kept sensible!</p>
        <p>Each page will have some interesting little challenge associated with it. These will build up as I go along. Right now I have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On my <a href="/">home page</a> the scroller scrolls a random source file in the dim background (simple one to start)</li>
            <li>On my <a href="/resume">resume page</a> I have bouncing logos in the background</li>
            <li>On my <a href="/evolution">evolution page</a> I've implemented the Life game in a couple of interesting ways</li>
        </ul>
