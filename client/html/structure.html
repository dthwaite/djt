        <h3>Opinion</h3>
        <p>It may seem odd to group the above three in the same topic, but for me their common
        denominator is structure. It's one of the reasons I like programming because you get to build cohesive, hierarchical
        structures of working bits that interact with each other to achieve a common goal.</p>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>The kind of music I enjoy listening to is well structured. I like the complicated harmonies and patterns that evolve
        as the music unfolds. The emotional experience of beauty that I can get when listening to music is directly attributable
        to the experience of "feeling" the structure as a unified whole. It is almost the same feeling when playing a particularly
        successful chess game or experiencing the beauty of a mathematical construct that encapsulates some physical process.</p>
        <p>I find it difficult to listen to music in the background. I'd rather not have it there. If there's (real) music playing
        then I want to pay attention to it. I have a pretty good grasp of music as I had a particularly musical upbringing being
        a chorister and Winchester Cathedral for 5 years. So I've grown to love a lot of church music. Bach is, of course, the big
        Daddy of them all (especially when it comes to structure) and I also like music of the romantic era. I very much like Schumann whose
        life story is as sad and beautiful as some of his music. I am a very poor piano player but I doggedly learn and play a few pieces (especially Schumann)
        and, despite my ineptitude, love to play these pieces. However there's a lot of classical music I find rather boring. So I also like
        modern music. Well, almost modern. Queen, Pink Floyd, Dire straits, Elton John, Abba etc. Abba's structure and harmonies are world class.
        I don't like jazz. Which is a shame as it appears many people get a lot out of jazz. Perhaps it is because jazz is relatively unstructured.</p>
        <h3>Chess</h3>
        <p>I've played a fair amount of amateur chess in my time. Like most of my leisure pursuits I'm not a serious player and am well below club standards
        but I can still play decently. Chess is an extraordinary game because it contains no random elements and has very few rules. Yet from simple beginnings a new, fresh, different
        game emerges every time you play. It's uncanny. At my level, getting through a complete game without any obvious blunders is an achievement in itself and when that happens
        it's a "good" game. It's an even better game if you win as a result of a slow and steady positional build up until the time eventually comes when your opponent
        has simply run out of options. You have to play chess intuitively. Most of the time you are simply making judgement decisions on whether a piece is better positioned
        here or over there. You do have to check the result of tactical sequences but you win by playing strategically.</p>
        <p>Ever since I was at university I wanted to write a chess program. But I never did and these days it's all been thoroughly done. Chess programs are generally
        pretty straight forward tree search algorithms with lots of short cuts and tricks. Computers are now fast enough to allow these programs to plough through
        vast numbers of combinations out of which emerges the ability to play world class chess. Out of which also emerges the illusion of strategic and "intelligent" play.
        Which, incidentally, is not dissimilar to our brains whose parallel computation power is such that "intelligence" and self awareness emerges.</p>
        <p>I did actually start writing a chess program a few years ago. But the reason was because I wanted to do so in a certain way. Instead of writing software I
        built an electronic logical circuit. Not a physical circuit, but one which I built with software! In other words, I wrote (in <mark>Java</mark>) a set of classes that
        simulated primitive logic gates and their connections (ANDs, ORs, XORs and NOTs) and then put those together to form more complex circuits (like any computer chip).
        I had flip-flops to store a binary bit, a chain of flip-flops to store many binary bits. I had adders and accummulators and all sorts of components.
            Every gate had a latency time of when a signal emerged at the output as a result of a signal arriving at the input.
            I then designed a big, complicated piece of circuitry that modelled a chess position.
            The circuitry  had various "sensors" that accumulated a total score for any position - a kind of static evaluation of the board.
            A clock signal would then trigger the circuitry to make the next valid move (for whoever's turn it was) storing the resultant score of that move
            (i.e. the static board position). I got as far as statically evaluating the score of each possible move and finding the best one. I think I lost
        a little interest when I discovered that my circuit, if built for real, would only have been about one order of magnitude faster than a traditional software
        program. And having a chess computer which is only 10 times faster than the next is not going to make that much difference. It was fun, though.</p>
        <h3>Mathematics</h3>
        <p>I'm only A level standard, but I would love to be more advanced at mathematics. When I do my Physics degree that time will come. Maths
        is a true wonder of human discovery. It is a way in which we can express and model the workings of the world using symbols. We've built up
        rules as to how we can manipulate those symbols which allow us to predict how things might work and what things might happen. The sensational
        part of all this is that these manipulations can reveal new insights about the world which, when we go look for the evidence, turn out to be true.
        In other words, we can use maths to discover hidden truths about the world. It's almost too good to be true.</p>
        <p>And there's no where more wonderful to show the efficy of Mathematics in the realm of Quantum Mechanics.
            Where the Maths <strong>actually is</strong> the reality. The mathematics of Quantum Mechanics describes a system which cannot really be physical
             - at least not as we understand the term. But physical reality emerges as a result and it emerges in exactly the way in which the maths predicts. It's quite rude, really.
