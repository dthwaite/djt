        <h1>Mathematics</h1>
        <p>An outstanding discovery</p>
        <p>It seems wholly unreasonable just how effective mathermatics is</p>
        <p>Not just in its use in modelling our world, but also as a means to predict and suggest</p>

        <h3>Opinion</h3>
        <p>I do love mathematics. But sadly, I very rarely practice it and I'm only capable into A-level territory</p>
        <p>Ofcourse there are many branches and specialisations, and I use this section as a rather weak opportunity
        to present an area of interest to me and that is simulations. Check out my <a href="simulation" target="_blank">Highway Simulator</a>. </p>
